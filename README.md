# HTTP, REST, WebSockets

## 🏃‍♂️ Simple start

1. **`npm install`** at the root
2. **`npx simple-git-hooks`** at the root
3. **`npm run dev`** at the root
4. open **`http://localhost:3421/`**

## 🧹 Code quality

We use linters to check code quality. All linters will run during commit. Make sure to enable pre-commit hook by running `npx simple-git-hooks`

To run linters manually, use the following commands:

- `npm run lint:editor`
- `npm run lint:fs`
- `npm run lint:js`
- `npm run lint:format`
- `npm run lint:type`

Run **`npm run format:fix`** at the root to fix code style issues.

## 🤞 Good luck
